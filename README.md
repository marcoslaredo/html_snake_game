# Snake Game
My intention is just recreative and I based this litle project at this one from 

WebDevSimplified https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Javascript-Snake-Game

At this moment, the basics are working...

Need more UI and UX

# To avoid CORS erros on executing on linux
- Open a terminal at the folder you cloned this repository and execute a simple python html server by: 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and open it at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/
